**WISDOM — Operational Governance Framework for Generative AI**

A minimal, structured framework to ensure ethical and accountable organizational use of Generative AI.

---

## 🔎 Transparency Statement

Generative AI tools were used exclusively to assist with formatting and structuring documentation.

The conceptual framework, safeguards, principles, and governance logic were developed through human expertise and independent reasoning.

WISDOM is a human-designed governance model.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

WISDOM enables organizations to:

* Identify risks associated with specific Generative AI use cases
* Activate structured Safeguards
* Define proportionate protection mechanisms
* Maintain explicit human responsibility
* Deploy validated operational workflows

WISDOM operates **per use case**, not at an abstract organizational level.

---

## What WISDOM Is

WISDOM is:

* A use-case-driven governance framework
* A structured risk activation mechanism
* A lightweight but complete safeguard system
* An operational method producing deployable workflows

---

## What WISDOM Is Not

WISDOM is not:

* A certification
* An ISO-like standard
* A technical model audit
* A legal compliance substitute
* A prompting or productivity guide
* A philosophical ethics debate

It is a practical governance activation framework.

## The WISDOM Model

W — Wellbeing
I — Intellectual Property
S — Security
D — Delegated Judgment
O — Overconsumption
M — Memory

Each Safeguard represents a major category of organizational risk related to Generative AI.

A single use case may activate multiple Safeguards.

---

## How It Works

For each real organizational use case:

1. Define the use case clearly
2. Complete the WISDOM Checklist
3. Activate relevant Safeguards
4. Apply the corresponding Safeguard playbooks
5. Formalize a WISDOM Champion Plan
6. Publish a validated operational Workflow

The result is a **structured, documented, and accountable AI-enabled process**.

## Governance Philosophy

WISDOM is based on one core principle:

> Performance never compensates for unmanaged risk.

An AI system that improves efficiency but lacks structured safeguards remains non-mastered.
