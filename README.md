# WISDOM

**WISDOM — AI Governance Framework**

Minimal operational governance framework for responsible organizational use of Generative AI.

---

## What WISDOM Is

WISDOM is an open-source governance framework designed to help organizations:

- Identify impact risks related to Generative AI use
- Activate structured safeguards
- Apply proportionate controls
- Enforce accountable human validation

It is modular, scalable, and use-case driven.

---

## What WISDOM Is Not

WISDOM is not:

- A certification
- An ISO standard
- A technical model audit
- A productivity or prompting guide

It is a governance activation mechanism.

W — Wellbeing  
I — Intellectual Property  
S — Security  
D — Delegated Judgment  
O — Overconsumption  
M — Memory  

Each use case may activate one or several safeguards.

1. Identify a real organizational use case  
2. Activate relevant safeguards  
3. Apply the corresponding playbooks  
4. Assess criticality  
5. Validate through accountable human oversight
